# PHP Coding Challenge: Product Detail Page

## Overview
This challenge tests your ability build a component driven design using PHP code to render HTML structures. The focus is on creating a clean, maintainable, and reusable codebase that adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Code principle.

## Challenge Instructions
Fork the repository to your GitHub account and then follow the instructions in this [Issue](https://github.com/temperandforge/TF-Coding-Challenge/issues/1).

### Time Expectation
This challenge should take approximately 4-6 hours to complete, please get as far as you can in that amount of time and commit code regularly along the way.

### AI Usage
Please do not use AI tools to generate code for this challenge. The goal is to assess your own coding skills and understanding of PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS. You will be asked to walk through your code and explain your approach during the review process.

### Running Local Development
To run this project locally, ensure you have a PHP server set up. You can use tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or the built-in PHP server.
An example using the built-in PHP server:
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/tf-coding-challenge
# Start the PHP built-in server
php -S localhost:8000
```
